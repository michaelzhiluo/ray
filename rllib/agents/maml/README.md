# Model Agnostic Meta-learning (MAML)

## Overview 

[MAML](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.03400) is on on-policy meta RL algorithm. Unlike standard RL algorithms, which aim to maximize the sum of rewards into the future for a single task (e.g. HalfCheetah-v2), meta RL algorithms seek to maximize the sum of rewards for *a given distribution of tasks*. 


## Documentation & Implementation:
